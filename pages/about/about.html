      <h1>About Bita Digital Hub</h1>

      <p class="intro-text">

        businesses who want to grow online without getting lost in tech, tools, and complexity.

      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>

    </section>

    <!-- PLATFORM -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>What We’re Building</h2>
      <p>

        operations. Today, the platform includes a growing set of focused tools:
      </p>

    </section>

    <!-- WHY AI-FIRST -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Why AI-First?</h2>
      <p>
        Online businesses run on repetitive tasks: content rewriting, page tweaks, analytics checks,
        and decision-making based on scattered data.
      </p>
      <p>Bita Digital Hub is being developed as an <strong>AI-first platform</strong>:</p>

      <ul class="feature-list">
        <li>Automating repetitive workflows instead of just accelerating them.</li>
        <li>Improving content quality and consistency across your online presence.</li>
        <li>Turning scattered metrics into simple, actionable business signals.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The goal is not to replace the entrepreneur — it’s to amplify them.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- AUDIENCE -->
    <section class="section">

    <!-- FOUNDER -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>A Note from the Founder</h2>
      <p>
        Bita Digital Hub was born from a simple observation: people struggle to start and grow online
        businesses not because they lack talent, but because the tools are overwhelming.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a background in data engineering, I created this platform to close that gap — building tools
        that create clarity, automate complexity, and support real progress.
