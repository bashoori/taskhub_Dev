    <!-- MISSION -->
    <section class="section about-mission">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Our mission is simple: make it possible for anyone, anywhere, to start and grow a real
          online business — without needing a big team, a huge budget, or deep technical skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          Behind every tool we build is the same idea: <strong>less friction, more action</strong>.
          Whether you’re converting files, optimizing a website, testing offers, or understanding
          your audience, you shouldn’t have to fight with ten different platforms to move forward.

        <h2>What We’re Building</h2>
        <p>
          Bita Digital Hub is evolving into a unified AI-driven platform for online business
          operations. Today, the platform includes a growing set of focused tools, such as:
        </p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li>
            <strong>File & content utilities</strong> – fast, browser-based tools for converting and
            preparing files for web, campaigns, and client work.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Website and SEO helpers</strong> – tools that help analyze, clean up, and
            improve your site so more of the right people actually find you.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Business & decision tools</strong> – tests, checklists, and flows that support
            better decision-making before you spend time or money on the wrong offer.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          These are the building blocks. Step by step, we’re connecting them into a single
          experience that feels like an AI-assisted teammate for your digital business.

    <!-- WHY AI-FIRST -->
    <section class="section about-ai">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Why AI-First?</h2>
        <p>
          Most online businesses are built on repetitive, manual work: rewriting content, tweaking
          landing pages, copying data between tools, checking numbers over and over.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bita Digital Hub is being designed as an <strong>AI-first platform</strong>:
        </p>
        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li>Use AI to automate repetitive tasks instead of just “speeding them up”.</li>
          <li>Improve content quality and consistency across pages, posts, and campaigns.</li>
          <li>
            Turn scattered data into simple, understandable signals that support real business
            decisions.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Our goal isn’t to replace the human behind the business, but to give them a smarter,
          faster toolkit so they can focus on the work only they can do.
        </p>
      </div>

    <!-- ROADMAP / FUTURE -->
    <section class="section about-roadmap">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Where We’re Going</h2>
        <p>
          The current tools are just the first layer. Our roadmap includes:
        </p>
        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Deeper AI-assisted workflows</strong> for content, landing pages, and funnels.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Dashboards and simple analytics</strong> that highlight the metrics that
            actually matter.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Pro accounts and APIs</strong> so advanced users can integrate Bita Digital Hub
            into their own systems and client work.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Under the hood, we’re moving more and more of the platform onto cloud-native, scalable
          infrastructure so it can grow with our users as their businesses grow.

    <!-- FOUNDER NOTE -->
    <section class="section about-founder">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>A Note from the Founder</h2>
        <p>
          Bita Digital Hub started from a simple observation: many smart, capable people never get
          their online business off the ground — not because their ideas are bad, but because the
          tools, tech, and decisions are overwhelming.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a background in data engineering and a deep interest in both technology and
          education, I’m building this platform to close that gap. The goal is not just to provide
          tools, but to provide clarity: clear steps, clear feedback, and a clear path forward.
        </p>
        <p class="signature">
